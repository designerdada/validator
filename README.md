# Validator [in development, unreleased] v0.0.0

> This validator is currently in development by [@toddmotto](//twitter.com/toddmotto) and [@allouis](//twitter.com/allouis_). Wouldn't advise using this until it's fully released at version 0.0.1, but please contribute to issues/pull requests. Check out the Issues tab to see how to help out.

Pure JS form validator + API (Browser support: IE8+, overrides HTML5 validation, does required (empty value/selections) and dynamic pattern checking on: inputs, textarea, select, radio, checkboxes).

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using Grunt.
